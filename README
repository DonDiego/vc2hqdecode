This is the VC-2 HQ Profile decoder library.

It is quite performant, and scales well across multiple threads.

The library is implemented in C++ but exposes a C API for applications
to link against.

a commercial license please contact < ipstudio@bbc.co.uk >

POSIX Platforms
===============

On POSIX platforms it can be built using the standards autotools process:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

the library itself will be built, along with the testsuite and a command-line
test decoder.

To run the test suite:

  make check

To run the commandline decoder:

  ./testprogs/vc2decode <input filename>

command line options exist, a help message can be extracted via:

  ./testprogs/vc2decode --help

Output format is raw planar 10-bit 4:2:2 video with active bits in the least 
significant 10-bits of each little-endian 16-bit word (ie. FFMPEG format 
yuv422p10le).



WINDOWS
=======

The Visual Studio solution file for Visual Studio 2015 is located in

  WINDOWS\vc2hqdecoder\vc2hqdecoder.sln

This will build the library, the test suite, and the command line decoder.
