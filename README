This is the VC-2 HQ Profile decoder library.

It is quite performant, and scales well across multiple threads.

The library is implemented in C++ but exposes a C API for applications
to link against.

POSIX Platforms
===============

On POSIX platforms it can be built using the standards autotools process:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

the library itself will be built, along with the testsuite and a command-line
test decoder.

To run the test suite:

  make check

To run the commandline decoder:

  ./testprogs/vc2decode <input filename>

command line options exist, a help message can be extracted via:

  ./testprogs/vc2decode --help



WINDOWS
=======

The Visual Studio solution file for Visual Studio 2015 is located in

  WINDOWS\vc2hqdecoder\vc2hqdecoder.sln

This will build the library, the test suite, and the command line decoder.
